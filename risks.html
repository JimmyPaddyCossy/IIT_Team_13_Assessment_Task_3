        <h1>Assessment of Risks</h1>
    
        <p>
            Risk is a part of our everyday lives and are sometimes inevitable, risk can come in all shapes and forms whether it be the chance of falling over or failing to complete certain task in a required time. No matter what industry or field of work you are in risk are always present but can almost always be avoided by following certain guidelines and procedures. The IT industry is full of risk which can lead to major issues in regards to a projects progress and can sometimes even lead to a project coming to an end. Below are a few examples of the most common risk that are found in the IT industry.

            Above is a Risk assessment chart, these can be used in all lines of work to determine the severity of risk in a project or task. For example, if a developer is using a new program that they have little experience on, the chances of them running into problems would be high, then they need to assess how big of an impact this risk will have on the project. Risk assessment charts are a fantastic way for employers and employees to assess the risk ahead and plane the project out around them which can intern minimise the overall effect that risk has on the project. 
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Risk that we at Team 13 foresee in our project include things like communication problems, deadlines not being met, misunderstanding of assigned task, time management for certain task of the project like learning Unity and understanding Kanban Board software. These are just a few of the risk that can occur during the development of ToDoTopia, but by following set guidelines and procedures we can decrease the likely hood of these risk occurring.  
        </p>
    
        <p>
            ToDoTopia is a sizable project, we are bound to run into issues and problems that can affect the overall progression of the project. As we progress through the project, we have encountered several problems that could have been avoided if a risk assessment were done before the project started. In saying that there are also problems that arose that we could not have foreseen, these include such issues like lack of communication between the team and failure to meet appointed deadlines.
